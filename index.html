            <p>Discover the beauty of a hidden microscopic world. All the following images were created in a laboratory, using a microscope and fluorescent bacteria. They come from real-life science experiments conducted at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
            <br> Do you want to understand how these images form? Try to use this  <a href="https://eshtel.github.io/microbialcommunity/" target="_blank">mini game</a>. It is a mathematical model which represents cells growing. 
            Each square is a bacteria that can divide. Use the buttons on the right to change biological properties and see the effect it has on the pattern!

            <p>Dive into the fascinating world of bacterial communities, meaning groups of bacteria that co-exist and grow together. 
                They can be found almost everywhere: in the soil of fields, on plants and even in the human body. These microorganisms build complex relationships and can create astonishing structures when they colonise surfaces. 
                The images shown here depict fluorescent bacteria growing in a culture dish. Their development, interactions and resulting patterns are followed by taking pictures with a microscope and analysed with informatics tools. 
                In my thesis, I explore these relationships using synthetic communities, meaning simplified ones, made of genetically modified bacteria to fill in specific functions. I especially work on bacteria that help each other to grow, by exchanging either essential nutrients for their survival or genetic material for antibiotic resistance. 
                These images are not just scientific illustrations; they reveal the hidden beauty of a microscopic world, inviting each and every one to appreciate the harmony and the complexity of bacterial relationships</p>

                    <figcaption class="image-caption"><b>Growing together</b><br>This image is a time-lapse of a co-culture of Escherichia coli exchanging amino acids. It reveals a bacterial community where two of its members – one in yellow, the other in blue – unite to grow together. Through a three-step growing process (days 1, 3, and 6, from left to right), their relationship evolves, nourished by a vital exchange of nutrients. Each bacterium plays a unique role, producing what the other one consumes. Their metabolic exchanges create delicate forms, demonstrating great harmony. Without this cooperation, neither one can survive. Together, they build a fragile but essential network whereby each shared molecule is key to their survival.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption class="image-caption"><b>A Gift of Survival</b><br>This image illustrates a bacterial community of Escherichia coli within an environment that contains a mortal antibiotic, ampicillin. To resist this molecule, the bacteria need a specific gene. The image shows in particular the transfer of the resistant gene to ampicillin. A member of the community, in blue, owns half of that gene. The yellow one owns the other half. The balance of this relationship relies on the blue bacterium’s capacity to transfer that DNA fragment to its neighbour. Once received, the yellow bacterium is able to build a complete gene, thus becoming resistant to the antibiotic and expanding in the environment. By doing so, the yellow bacteria degrade the antibiotic surrounding them, allowing the blue bacteria to survive. The image on the left shows the blue bacteria only, while the one on the right shows the yellow bacteria. The central image is a superimposition of both.</figcaption>
